## Development Notes

* DEV environment consists of Git Hub Desktop, Visual Studio Code, Powershell.
* Making use of the existing `dotnet` project templates
    * `dotnet new gitignore`
    * `dotnet new angular`
* Setup and install `node.js` and `chocolatey` as apparently neither are currently intalled, and are required by the default project template(s).
    * Another option would be to use docker containers to do the builds, which could then be used for a CI/CD pipeline as well.

* While performing intallation of `node.js` and `chocolatey` tools and dependencies. Found the following image to use a background
